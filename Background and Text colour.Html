          <p style="color:red;">A mother is the one who brings us to life, our first home. The one person who introduces us to this world. For a mother, her child will always remain a child no matter what age.  Mother's love, care & support is huge.  Being a single child, she loves me the most.</p>
          <p style="color: green;">A mother is the most important person in the life of a person. She's a major influence. She makes many sacrifices while raising her child. Mothers are one of those people who shapes a person's nature & character. The most powerful character in my life is my mom. She is a superwoman. My mother is always there for me, irrespective of what the situation might be.</p>
          <p style="color: blue;">Like all mothers, my mother is a very hard-working woman. Everything I am today in my life is because of my mother. She’s my first teacher, my first guide. From my nature, to the way I talk, interact & respond to situations is because of her, her upbringing & the values she has installed in me. She never gives up on me & supports me in all situations. Being a person who has a sharp vision & judge of character, she always helps me while dealing with new people & situations.</p>
          <p style="color: rgb(208, 255, 192);">Her humble & kind nature is what I like about her the most. Whenever I achieve something, she gets me gifts & gives me blessings. She has always taught me to be strong & determined. From my nature, to the way I talk, interact & respond to situations is because of her, her upbringing & the values she has installed in me. She has always been my inspiration.    </p>
          <p style="color: #44ec4a;">My mother’s level of acceptance and tolerance, surprises me. No matter what the situation might be, she remains calm and patient. My mother means the world to me and I love her the most. My mother knows me in and out. Mothers spend a significant part of their lives making us capable of standing on our own feet. Due to this, they sacrifice their own career and happiness for that.</p>
          <p style="color: #ec4918;">The significance of mothers in our lives is immense. She has made me the person I am today. Her experience in life, has taught me a lot. She is my shoulder to cry on. My constant pillar of support, I love her immensely. My greatest source of strength and support, she is there with me through all of life’s ups and downs.</p>
          <p style="color: purple;">Mothers have many roles to play like that of a Protector, a Friend, and Guide for Life. A Mother is selfless when it comes to her child. The love of a Mother is unconditional. Mothers are a major influence in an individual's life. The foundation of a human being's life and existence, is majorly shaped by a mother's role.</p>
          <p style="color: brown;">A mother is God’s most significant gift to mankind. A woman may be considered a mother by virtue of having given birth, by raising a child who may or may not be her biological offspring, or by supplying her ovum for fertilisation in the case of gestational surrogacy.</p>
          <p style="color: yellowgreen;">Her utter dedication and devotion is inspiring. I love how she carries herself, takes all responsibilities with the utmost sincerity & commitment. At times, even before I say anything, she knows what I want or what I am going through. She has taught me no matter how bad a situation might get, only love can improve it in the most effective way.</p>
